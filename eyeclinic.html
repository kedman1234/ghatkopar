	        Vision testing involves making a person read standard sized letters at a specified distance. The doctors record the vision as a fraction e.g. 6/6 etc. The top number denotes the distance (in feet) at which the patient has been able to read the particular sized letter while the bottom number indicates the distance at which a normal person is expected to read the same letter. Near vision is tested separately in good illumination using special test charts held at normal reading distance. The testing is done with each eye separately. The doctors often test the vision using a pinhole. This gives an estimate of improvement possible with glasses. The patient in place of glasses cannot use the pinhole.

	        This is an important test that is done by the ophthalmologist or more often by the optometrist. The eye is like a camera. The light rays are focused on to the light sensitive film in the back of the eye called the retina. This focusing is made possible by the cornea (a clear watch glass like structure in the front of the eye) and by the lens in the eye (similar to the lens of a camera). Refraction is done usually in the normal state. On occasion (especially in children) it may have to be done using special eye drops (cycloplegics). In this situation one may have to retest the power of the required glasses 2-3 days after the testing with the use of drops. Refraction involves two parts. The first part is objective where in the refractionist estimates the power needed by using a test called retinoscopy. This test can also be done with a machine called the automatic refractometer (so called computer testing). However one still needs to do the all-important subjective testing (i.e. testing the response of the patient with different powered glasses) before prescribing the glasses. Hence do not be misled by the so-called computer testing.

	        One of the most common procedures that is done in an eye specialist's office is dilatation. The pupils of the eye constrict or dilate depending upon the light that thrown at the eye. For examining the back part of the eye (fundus), the doctor uses an instrument called ophthalmoscope. To get a good view of the back of the eye, one needs to dilate the pupils. This permits more light to enter the eye and gives a better image of the fundus. To keep the pupils dilated despite the intense light, one needs to dilate the pupils. There are various types of dilating drops available. The faster acting ones may dilate the pupil in 15-20 minutes time. Other variety of drops may take up to 30-45 minutes for good dilatation. The effect of dilatation usually lasts up to 6 hours. Some of them may retain the effect for 24 hours. Usually the drops used for routine eye examination do not have long lasting effect. A patient is expected to have glare in the sun light while still under the effect of the drops. Hence driving may become difficult. If you had similar dilatation in the past and have been noted to be allergic to any one of them, please inform the same to your doctor.

	        This is a very important step in the total examination of the eyes. The visible portion of the eye is easily examined by the slit lamp examination. The back portion of the eye can only be examined by using the ophthalmoscope. This step usually needs dilatation of the pupils. This test involves throwing bright light into the eye and examining the image of the back of the eye using special lenses. For Indirect opththalmoscopy, the patient has to be in the reclining position for proper examination. Sometimes the slit lamp may be used for detailed evaluation of the areas of the back of the eye such as macula, optic disc etc.

	        Potential acuity meter testing enables one to have an idea about the possible visual recovery following cataract surgery. In this testing the doctor projects a chart of letters or numbers into the back of the eye through the gaps in the cataract that enables the patient to read the letters. Depending upon the number of lines that one could read, the potential for recovery of vision is estimated. One should realize that this is only an approximate estimate and very often the true recovery of vision is greater that the estimate.

        This recent innovation allows measurement of the thickness of the nerve fibre layer, which is the part of the retina that is first affected in the disease of glaucoma. The nerve fibril layer defect is detected long before any defect is noted in the function of the eye including the field examination. This test may help in the early detection of significant damage caused by glaucoma and help in the follow up of these patients. The test involves the use of scanning laser that passes through the nerve fibre layer and in the process undergoes a process called retardation. By measuring the extent of retardation the machine calculates the thickness of the nerve fibre layer.

        This is an advanced technology in ultrasonography, which permits high-resolution pictures of the front of the eye. The technology enables the measurement of the angle of the eye, which is otherwise not accessible for measurement. The angle of the eye is the path through which the fluid in the eye finds access outside. The angle can become closed in certain individuals. This propensity to closure of the angle can be more adequately predicted using this advanced testing. Following injury to the eye, sometimes abnormal communications develop leading to excess drainage of fluid and resulting soft eyes. These abnormal sites can be best identified by UBM.

        This is an important test to evaluate a variety of retinal disease such as diabetic retinopathy. This is one of the commonest tests performed for retinal diseases. The test involves injecting a dye called sodium fluorescein into the blood stream and taking photographs of the retina using special filters. The test is important to stage the disease as well as to guide treatment with laser photocoagulation. Present generation digital cameras permit manipulation of the pictures and for instant viewing without need for development of the film etc.

        Indocyanine angiography is similar to the fluorescein angiography but involves injection of a different dye called Indocyanine green. The test utilizes a special infrared sensitive camera to capture the images digitally. Very often indocyanine and fluorescein angiography are combined in a given patient to give maximum information. Indocyanine angiography gives more information regarding the choroidal vessels compared to fluorescein angiography that gives more information regarding the retinal blood vessels.

        These two tests are done to evaluate the function of the retina. Light is projected onto the retina and electrical potentials that occur normally in the eye are recorded using special electrodes placed near and on the eye. Certain retinal degenerative diseases are diagnosed only on testing with electroretinography. Specialized computer soft ware is needed to analyze the data.

        There are certain diseases that may lead to permanent partial loss of vision. These patients can be sometimes helped to some extent by using special aids called low vision aids. There are a variety of these available and most of them are fine tuned for a specific function. Most of them have been made to enable reading fine print. It is important that the patient should be motivated to use them. They are used at a closer range than normal working distance and hence one needs to get used to the same. Computers and closed circuit television are also useful as low vision aids. One has to test different varieties before choosing what is appropriate for them.

        Ultrasonography is test that permits the evaluation of the back of the eye in case of opaque media. In a normal eye one is able to see the back of the eye using instruments such as indirect ophthalmoscope. In conditions of disease and injury the cornea, the lens or the vitreous cavity can become opaque and prevent this visualization. In these circumstances, ultrasound can be used to scan the eye and get useful information about the tissues lying behind the opaque media. This information is needed not only for proper diagnosis but also to plan the surgery where indicated.

	        An important part of the evaluation of a patient with squint is the cover test and prism tests. These tests are conducted in the office of the eye doctor itself. Using these tests the eye doctor is able to classify the type of the squint and to grade the severity of the same. This information is needed to plan the treatment including surgery where needed. With a torch light and a set of loose prisms the eye doctor is able to evaluate squint to a great degree.

	        Orthoptics is the study of how effectively the two eyes function together (binocular vision). This testing is done on many instruments including the synaptophore.. Special instruments are used to measure the near point of convergence and near point of accommodation. These points give a guide as to how difficult it is for a person to view near objects. Many people with eyestrain on performing near work may be helped by exercises after the orthoptic evaluation.
